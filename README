                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC, libpng, and any dependencies of wla-dx.

You'll first need a ROM image of Magic Knight Rayearth for the Game Boy. It
should match the following specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Magic Knight Rayearth (Japan) (SGB Enhanced).gb
  CRC32:             94838a81
  MD5:               06b75e657debd1568f18d369cc2422dd
  SHA-1:             4f77031946e62772a241a9b5b046d7fcf6a28ea8

Rename it "mkrgb.gb" and place it in the "mkrgb" folder. Then:

$ cd mkrgb
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as mkrgb_en.gb.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

See COPYING. Basically, everything by me (Supper) is GPLv3, and everything else
is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
