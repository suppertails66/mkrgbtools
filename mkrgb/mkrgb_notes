scripts:
	scripts are stored starting at 0x30000 and are treated
	as a single contiguous unit.
	this is the offset from the start of that block, so
	0x0000 = 0x30000, 0x4000 = 0x34000, etc.

routines:
	04ed = memSet
	0517 = sendToVram
				 (safe send, waiting for mode 0/1)
				 BC = length
				 DE = dst
				 HL = src
	1E54 = fetchScriptByte
	1E7A = fetchActiveScriptByte
	1e8e = switchBank
				 A = banknum
	1E94 = copyLiteralToVram
				 A = index
				 returns index of tile in VRAM that graphics data was copied to

font:
  0x1800A: font 1 (hiragana)
           - 0x18006 seems to be offset within bank to this
  0x238F2: font 2 (katakana)
           - 0x20004 seems to be offset within bank to this
